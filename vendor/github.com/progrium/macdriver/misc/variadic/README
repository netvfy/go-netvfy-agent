Package variadic
================

This packge implements variadic calling conventions for calling foreign C code from within Go.

The primary motivation for this package was to be able to interface with Apple's Objective-C
runtime on Mac OS X, which uses a variadic function (objc_msgSend) for sending messages to objects.

Status
======

amd64:  Works pretty well - http://github.com/mkrautz/objc uses it (only tested on darwin, though!)

386:    Works on linux/386 and darwin/386

        Note: darwin/386 requires 16 byte stack alignment, and no
        effort has been made to support this at the moment. However,
        the tests pass on darwin/386 - not sure if I've been lucky.
